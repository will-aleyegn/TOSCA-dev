# TOSCA Application Changes Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing QLineEdit Import**
   - Added QLineEdit to the imports in camera_display.py to fix the "name 'QLineEdit' is not defined" error.

2. **References to Removed UI Elements**
   - Fixed references to `self.exposure_value_label` and `self.gain_value_label` which were replaced with input fields.
   - Updated all methods to use the new input fields instead of the old labels.

3. **Default COM Port**
   - Changed the default COM port from COM3 to COM4 in actuator_control.py.

4. **Startup Tab**
   - Modified main_window.py to open to the patient tab instead of the camera tab on startup.

5. **Standardized File Locations**
   - Updated patient_data.py to use a standardized location within the working directory for patient data.
   - Modified camera_display.py to save captured images to a standardized location (data/captures).

## Improvements

1. **Input Fields for Exposure and Gain**
   - Added input fields for exposure and gain values to allow direct numeric input.
   - Implemented validation and handling for these input fields.
   - Connected input fields to the camera settings.

2. **Standardized Data Directory Structure**
   - Created a consistent directory structure for all data:
     - Patient data: data/patients/[patient_id]/
     - Captured images (no patient): data/captures/
     - Patient images: data/patients/[patient_id]/images/

## Testing

The application was successfully tested with the following operations:
- Application startup (now opens to patient tab)
- Camera connection and streaming
- Image capture (saved to data/captures directory)
- Camera disconnection and application shutdown

All operations completed successfully with no errors.
